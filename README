# cpu-c-sim
In my PhD thesis, I'm using the gem5 simulator. This project is to learn more about cycle-accurated, event-driven simulators, and x86 microarchitecture.

This project is going to be mainly develop in C89 as much as possible (some extensions could be used).

Feel free to make comments, contribute with issues, or even with code :)
